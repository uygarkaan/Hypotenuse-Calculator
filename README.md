## Hypotenuse Calculator

## Project Overview

The **Hypotenuse Calculator** is a simple Java application that calculates the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two other sides (A and B). 

## Features

- **User Input:** Prompts the user to input the lengths of sides A and B.
- **Calculation:** Computes the square of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Output:** Displays the square of the hypotenuse.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of the key components in the code:

- **Input Gathering:** The program reads the lengths of sides A and B from the user.
- **Hypotenuse Calculation:** The program calculates the squares of sides A and B and adds them to find the square of the hypotenuse.
- **Output:** The square of the hypotenuse is displayed to the user.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the program might work:
```Enter the length of side A: 3 Enter the length of side B: 4```
